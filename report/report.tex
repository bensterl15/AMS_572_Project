\section{Introduction}

It has been well established by The United States Environmental Protection Agency and other independent organizations that average temperature is increasing across the country. This study examines monthly temperature data from two stations: Rye Patch Dam, Nevada, and Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah. These stations were chosen because they are roughly at the same latitude, $40.498^{\circ}N$ and $40.790^{\circ}N$, roughly at the same elevation, $1260.3$m and $1287.8$m, relatively close longitudes, $118.316^{\circ}$W and $111.980^{\circ}$W, for Rye Patch and Salt Lake City respectively. The goal of the first hypothesis is to examine whether the effects of climate change statistically differ between these two locations; if they do, we can infer the climate change is predominantly man-made.
