To run the R scripts, it is imperative to do so from the /data subdirectory as both reference data from a relative path. The team ran the scripts from Terminal with the "Rscript" command instead of RStudio; they could possibly be run from RStudio, but we did not test it with this. 

If not installed already, one can install the libraries used by the scripts by entering the following commands in Terminal:

\begin{itemize}
	\item R
	\item $>$install.packages("ggpubr")
	\item $>$install.packages("ggplot2")
	\item $>$install.packages("latex2exp")
	\item $>$install.packages("car")
	\item $>$install.packages("corrplot")
	\item $>$install.packages("leaps")
\end{itemize}

One can run the scripts by executing the following commands in Terminal:

\begin{itemize}
	\item cd $<$Base Directory$>$/AMS\_572\_Project/data
	\item Rscript Hypothesis\_1.R
	\item Rscript Hypothesis\_2.R
\end{itemize}
